# CarrierATC

A web mobile game inspired by the Airport Madness game series.  

[**Demo link**](https://raw.githack.com/Timi007/CarrierATC/master/dist/index.html)

## Controls 
- Control flight path of aircraft by drawing on the screen. Navigate the aircraft to the runway.
- Collision of two aircraft results in a **GAME OVER**.
- Tap rearmed aircraft once to order the aircraft to prepare for takeoff.
- Swipe with two fingers over the catapult (takeoff runway; swipe path visible as white line) to order the aircraft to takeoff.

## Disclaimer 
I developed the game as a uni project without thinking much about resolution aspects and scaling, so don't expect much.

Tested with tablet which has a `712px x 1018px` (width x height) canvas resolution (tablet held upright) on Chrome for Android.  
Should also work with phones which have resolutions higher `412px x 756px`.
